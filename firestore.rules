/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SustentaAI.
 *
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset provides open read access to all data, assuming the data is inherently public. Write access is explicitly denied, as there's no authentication mechanism to properly restrict write operations in the current setup.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /products/{productId}: Product information and environmental impact data.
 * - /sdgs/{sdgId}: Sustainable Development Goal information.
 * - /green_areas/{greenAreaId}: Green area (parks, reserves) information.
 * - /developers/{developerId}: Developer information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: All `get` and `list` operations are allowed for all collections, as the data is intended to be publicly accessible.
 * - No Write Access: All `create`, `update`, and `delete` operations are explicitly denied due to the lack of user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
 * - No denormalization or custom authorization logic is implemented, as the data is treated as read-only for now.
